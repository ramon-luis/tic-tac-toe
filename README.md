Student: Ramon L. Rodriguez

Assignment: HW5

Comments:
* HW was completed as assigned and tested with no errors. 
* I elected to make my game board views (i.e. game slots where a piece can be
placed) slightly larger than the physical space: if a game piece was released
while inside the view then it would be accepted.  This prevented having to
evaluate situations where a gamepiece intersected with multiple UIViews: only a
single game slot view could contain a game piece.
